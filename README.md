# RISC-V Soft-Core Processor on FPGA using Open-Source Tools Only

This repository contains the final project for the Electrical and Computer Engineering program at Ben-Gurion University. The project demonstrates the implementation of a custom RISC-V soft-core processor on the Lattice iCEBreaker FPGA, using only free and open-source tools.

## üß† Project Overview

The goal of the project was to design, implement, and test a RISC-V compatible CPU entirely from scratch, using Verilog and open-source FPGA toolchains. The processor supports RV32I instruction set and includes:
- Multi-cycle core synthesized on FPGA
- Pipelined and optimized pipelined cores simulated in Verilator
- Full toolchain: synthesis, place & route, bitstream generation, simulation, and programming‚Äîall without proprietary software
